  <h4>Here's a time line of Zuckerberg's life:</h4>
  <ul id="backgroundcolor">
  <b id="posisibiografi">The Origin of Facebook</b>
  </ul>
  <p id="tribute-info">Mark Zuckerberg is a member of Alpha Epsilon Pi, at first Zuckerberg was just a student at Harvard University. He then tried to create a social networking system for his class. However, after he created the system, it turned out that more and more people wanted to join it. So that the system has long since captured the nearest university from where he studied and this is the beginning of Facebook as we know it today.</p>
  <p id="tribute-info">From this situation Zuckerberg has the initiative to be able to develop the network system, at first Zuckerberg developed this system and gave the name Facebook. Zuckerberg and his friends then rented a place in Palo Alto, California as a location to develop Facebook. Due to the preoccupation with developing the Facebook project, Zuckerberg forgot about his lectures. He was also faced with a very difficult choice, namely between choosing his education or doing business on the project he was developing.</p>
  <ul id="backgroundcolor">
    <b id="posisibiografi2">Choose Drop-Out and focus on Facebook</b>
  </ul>
  <p id="tribute-info">With a high optimistic attitude, Zuckerberg and his friends finally chose to leave college and focus on the Facebook project. long ago, when at Philips Exeter Academy high school, he and his friend, D'Angelo made a plug-in for the Winamp MP3 Player. The plug-in is a PC or computer program that can interact with the host application, such as a web browser or email for certain purposes.</p>
  <p id="tribute-info">When they continued their education to college, the two separated, D'Angelo attended Caltech while Zuckerberg himself entered Harvard. This is where he came up with the idea of making an online student directory book because the university does not share face books with new students as a place for friendship between them. But, every time he offered to make the directory, Harvard always refused.</p>
  <ul id="backgroundcolor">
    <b id="posisibiografi2">CourseMatch is my first project</b>
  </ul>
  <p id="tribute-info">Even though he was rejected, he always looked for ways to make it happen without giving up. His first project was CourseMatch which allowed his classmates to communicate with each other on the website. One night in his sophomore year at Harvard, he took data from Harvard students and put it on the website he created, Facemash. Because it was considered stealing data, Zuckerberg was finally sued. But even so he did not regret his actions. Instead he created a new website, namely Facebook. This website was founded in 2004. Facebook is an enhancement of Facemash. The goal remains as a meeting place for fellow students at Harvard. As the founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg explained on his website that Facebook is a social tool to help someone communicate more efficiently with friends, family, and coworkers.</p>
  <p id="tribute-info">Not only that, Facebook also offers easy-to-use navigation for its users. Each account owner has space to display personal photos, friends, network, and also do other things such as sending messages and others. Incredibly, until now, Facebook users, founded by Mark Zuckerberg, are very numerous and continue to grow every time.</p>
